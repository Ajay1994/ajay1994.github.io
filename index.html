				I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Information, UT Austin. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ying Ding. My primary research is building reliable artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in Healthcare. I am developing AI algorithms across computer vision, natural language processing which assists in critical medical decision-making. I am also interested in knowledge discovery, mining complex and obscure patterns, and designing innovative ways to approach, analyze, and understand information conveyed in huge unstructured corpora.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I completed my Masters in Computer Science from IIT Kharagpur. I was advised by Prof. Animesh Mukherjee and Prof. Pawan Goyal at the CNeRG Lab. I have also worked as Lead Research Engineer at Advanced Technology Lab, Samsung Electronics, India under the supervision of Dr. Vijay Narayan Tiwari.
