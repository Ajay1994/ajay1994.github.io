				<p style="font-size:20px;display: inline-block;">I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Information, UT Austin. I am fortunate to be advised by 
					<a href = "https://yingding.ischool.utexas.edu/" style="color:#800000">Prof. Ying Ding</a>. 
					My primary research is building reliable artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in Healthcare. I am developing AI algorithms 
					across computer vision, natural language processing which assists in critical medical decision-making. I am also interested in 
					knowledge discovery, mining complex and obscure patterns, and designing innovative ways to approach, analyze, and understand 
					information conveyed in huge unstructured corpora.</p>

				<p style="font-size:20px;display: inline-block;">Prior to joining UT Austin, I completed my Masters in Computer Science from IIT Kharagpur. 
					I was advised by 
					<a href = "https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/" style="color:#800000">Prof. Animesh Mukherjee</a> and 
					<a href = "https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/" style="color:#800000">Prof. Pawan Goyal</a> at the CNeRG Lab. I have also worked as Lead Research Engineer
