------------------

Automated for labelling or extracting structured information from MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert involves:
1. Automated Radiology report labellers:
   a. Chexpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison. CoRR, abs/1901.07031, 2019 
   b. Negbio: a high-performance tool for negation and uncertainty detection in radiology reports. AMIA, 2018
   c. Chexpert++: Approximating the chexpert labeler for speed, differentiability, and probabilistic output. 2020
   d. Chexbert: combining automatic labelers and expert annotations for accurate radiology report labeling using bert. 2020
   e. Visualchexbert: addressing the discrepancy between radiology report labels and image labels. 2021
   
2. Extraction of more fine-grained information:
   a. Enhancing the expressiveness and usability of structured image reporting systems. 2000
   b. Information extraction from multi-institutional radiology reports. 2016
   c. Understanding spatial language in radiology: representation framework, annotation, and spatial relation extraction from chest x-ray reports using deep learning. 2020
   d. Toward complete structured information extraction from radiology reports using machine learning. 2019
   e. Extracting clinical terms from radiology reports with deep learning. 2021
